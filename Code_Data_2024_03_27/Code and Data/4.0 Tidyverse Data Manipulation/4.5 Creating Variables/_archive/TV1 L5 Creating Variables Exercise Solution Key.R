# Construct a data frame called vs_analysis using vs.sas7bdat from the course 
# level directory and the following requirements/steps.
# a.	Read in the following variables SUBJECT, VISIT, SYSBP, DIABP, PULSE, TEMP.
# b.	Create a new variable named VisitSeq that maps the following VISIT values 
#    to the corresponding numbers.
#    	(screen = 0 , day1 = 1, wk2 = 2, wk4 = 3, wk6 = 4, wk8 = 5, wk12 = 6, 
#       wk16 = 7, eoset = 8).
# c.	Create a new variable name MAP which is calculated by 
#    (1/3) * SYSBP + (2/3)*DIABP. Round it to the 1st decimal place.
# d.	Create a new variable named TempF which is calculated by TEMP*(9/5) + 32. 
# e.	Sort by SUBJECT and VisitSeq.
# f.	Once your data frame is built, add descriptive labels to your newly 
#    calculated variables using the var_label function from the labelled package.
