# Exercise Step 3
# Read the file adae.rds from the course directory into a data frame called adae.
raw_vs <- read_sas('data/vs.sas7bdat')

# Construct a data frame called vs_analysis using vs.sas7bdat from the course level directory and the following
# requirements/steps.
# a.	Read in the following variables SUBJECT, VISIT, SYSBP, DIABP, PULSE, TEMP.
# b.	Create a new variable named VisitSeq that maps the following VISIT values to the corresponding numbers.
#    	screen = 0 , day1 = 1, wk2 = 2, wk4 = 3, wk6 = 4, wk8 = 5, wk12 = 6, wk16 = 7, eoset = 8).
#    	Move that variable to be after the VISIT variable.
# c.	Create a new variable name MAP which is calculated by (1/3) * SYSBP + (2/3)*DIABP. Round it to the 1st decimal place.
#    	Move the variable to be after the DIABP variable.
# d.	Create a new variable named TempF which is caluclated by TEMP*(9/5) + 32. Move the variable to be after the TEMP variable.
# e.	Sort by SUBJECT and VisitSeq.
# f.	Create a variable called LastMAP which is equal to NA at screen but equal to the lag(MAP) for other records.
# g.	Create a variable named Diff_fromLastMAP which is calculated by MAP - Diff_fromLastMAP.
# h.	Once your data frame is built, add descriptive lables to your newly calculated variables using the var_label
#    	function from the labelled package.
