# Title: Shiny Debugging for the R User

# Packages & Functions on Display:
# - {base  4.2.3}: browser, cat(file = stderr())
# - {shiny 1.7.3}: runnApp(display.mode = "showcase"), options(shiny.reactlog = T)


# Concepts ----------------------------------------------------------------

# We'll cover pausing execution to inspect Shiny operations, tracing information
# throughout the operation so that we don't have to pause it, and then finding
# the source of errors and finding their cause

# ---

# RStudio Debug Menu
# Breakpoints do not work in Shiny scripts, but we can use the `browser()`
# to step through code.  This works in either the server or the ui sections

# ---

# Shiny Showcase Mode
# We can use 'showcase mode' to visualize which portions of code are running as
# a user is interacting with the code. Showcase Mode works best when running in
# external window

# rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path |>
# shiny::runApp("C:/Users/User/OneDrive - ManpowerGroup/Stage 4/Content/Course Development/Building Shiny Applications/4. Debug - For the R User/app-training/app.R", display.mode = "showcase")

# ---

# Reactive Interaction Log
# Using the 'reactive log' helps us visualize the reactive interactions. We
# include this option in the application script, then we hit CTRL+F3 once the
# application is running. This gives us a summary of the runtimes between elements.
# If this seems valuable to you, read more: https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/

# options(shiny.reactlog = T)

# ---

# Using print statements we can use `cat(file = stderr())` to print messages to
# the console, describing exactly what is happening in the Shiny process
