# **8 Creating ADaM Datasets**

In this course, we create ADaM data frames.

## **8.1 Introduction**

This introduction lesson will contain the following activities:

-   Using data frame specifications

-   Finishing partially completed code

-   Using look up tables

-   Discussion on comparing expected vs actual results

## **8.2 ADaM Data Set Builds**

The rest of the lessons focus on building out an ADaM data set by following specifications in a spreadsheet and/or by following instructions in the exercise. For each data set built, we compare the actual results to a data set with the expected results.

We will have the learner build or finish building the following ADaM data sets to finish out this course:

-   `ADSL`

-   `ADVS`

-   `ADAE`

-   `ADLB`

-   `ADEX`
